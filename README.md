# This was a 2 week project created for a coding bootcamp final

My goal was to create a simple cafe website with multiple routes using react router.
It connects to a mongodb database and features user login/auth with Auth0.

In the end I did not get to add all the functionality I originally envisioned, however as someone
who previously struggled to touch backend programming, I'm glad to have gained the experience.
